                https://reactivemanifesto.org

                Published in 2013 to provide a common vocabulary for disussing the design of reactive systems

                    ## Responsive

                    * Focus on providing rapid and consistent response times

                    Note:
                    In order to facilitate Responsiveness, two challenges need to be faced: being Responsive under failure, defined as Resilience, and being Responsive under load,

                    ## Elastic

                    * Stays responsive under varying workload
                    * Increase / decrease resources
                    * Design without central bottlenecks
                    * Be able to replicate components

                    <!-- Speaker notes
                    No bottlenecks: Mogelijkheid moet hebben om componenten op te delen en te repliceren

                    ## Resilient

                    * Stays responsive in the face of faillure
                    * Achieved by replication, containment, isolation and delegation

                    Note:
                    Containment: isoleren van fouten
                    Delegation: Delegate recovery to another component

                    Failures need to be:
                    1. Contained
                    2. Reified
                    3. Signaled - Asynchronously
                    4. Observed - By 1-N
                    5. Managed

                    Coffee machine -> insert coins -> no beans
                    Insert coins -> signals out of coffee beans failure -> service guy -> refill beans -> gets coffee
